Usage:
         jtreg options... tests...

Tests can be given as files or folders containing test files, or by means of
test groups. Long lists of options and tests may be encapsulated in "at-files".


Verbose Options
                These options control the amount of output written to the
                console while running tests

    -v | --v:<value> | -verbose | --verbose:<value>
                    Increase the amount of output written to the console. A
                    value, or selected combinations of values separated by
                    commas, may be given to select the type of output desired.
        default         Three lines of output per test: start, end, status
        summary         One line of output per test: status, test name
        all             Selected contents of JTR file for all tests (includes
                        stdout/stderr)
        pass            Selected contents of JTR file for passed tests
        fail            Selected contents of JTR file for failed tests
        error           Selected contents of JTR file for errored tests
        nopass          Suppress output for tests that passed
        time            Elapsed time per action
        multirun        Updates for each testsuite when tests from more than one
                        are being executed.
    -v1             Short for -verbose:summary
    -va             Short for -verbose:all
    -ve             Short for -verbose:error
    -vf             Short for -verbose:fail
    -vp             Short for -verbose:pass
    -vt             Short for -verbose:time

                    each test. If a value is not given for a name, the current
                    value of the environment variable will be used. Standard
                    environment variables, like DISPLAY, LANG, windir,
                    SystemRoot, etc, will automatically be given to each test,
                    if they are set in the current environment.
    -g | -gui       Access regression extensions via the standard JavaTest
                    harness gui

                    Specify how to handle tests containing an @ignore tag.
        quiet           Completely ignore such tests.
        error           (Default.) Execute the actions up to the @ignore tag,

        run             Run the test, as though the @ignore tag were not
                        present.
    -l | -listtests
                    List the tests that would be executed instead of executing
                    them.
    -lock:<file>    Lock file to use for tests in "exclusive access" directories
                    when running tests in multiple concurrent instances of
                    jtreg.
    -nativepath:<path>

                    the tests.
    -noignore       suppress the effect of any @ignore tags, allowing the test
                    to proceed as if the @ignore tags were not present.
                    Deprecated: see the -ignore option.
    -nr | -noreport
                    Do not generate a final report.
    -o:<classname> | -observer:<classname>
                    Specifies the class to observe the progress of a test suite;
                    the class must implement a specific interface; contact a
                    developer for details. E.g. -o:SampleRegressionObserver
    -od:<path> | -observerDir:<path> | -op:<path> | -observerPath:<path>
                    Specifies the pathname of a directory or .jar file in which
                    the observer class is located. The given pathname is simply
                    appended to the CLASSPATH used for the tests, thus care
                    should be taken when naming an observer not to collide with
                    the names of classes internal to the JavaTest harness or the
                    JRE, e.g., put the observer class in its own named package.
    -r:<directory> | -reportDir:<directory>
                    All report files placed here; "./JTreport" is default
    -report:<value>
                    Configure the report generated after tests are run.
        none            Do not generate a report; equivalent to -noreport.
        executed        Include tests executed in the latest run
        all-executed    Include all tests that have been executed in current
                        work directory
        all             Include all tests that are present in the test suite,
                        whether or not they have been executed
    -retain | --retain:<pass,fail,error,all,file-pattern>,...
                    Specify files to be retained after each test completes
                    executing. If -retain is not specified, only the files from
                    the last test executed will be retained. If -retain is
                    specified with no argument, all files will be retained.
                    Otherwise, the files may be described by one or more of the
                    following values:
        none            Do not retain any of the files generated by each test
        pass            Retain files generated by tests that pass
        fail            Retain files generated by tests that fail
        error           Retain files generated by tests that caused an error
        all             Retain all files generated by each test
        file-pattern    Retain files that match a specific filename. The name
                        may contain '*' to match any sequence of characters. For
                        example, result.* or *.err.
    -ro | -reportOnly
                    Generate report for previously executed tests. This does not
                    re-run any tests. A work directory containing the results of
                    the executed tests must be provided. The default location is
                    "./JTwork". To specify an alternate directory, use -workDir.
    -show:<section-name>
                    Show information from a section in the results file for a
                    test. For example, -show:rerun
    -showGroups     Show the expansion (to files and directories) of the groups
                    given on the command line. To see the expansion of all the
                    groups in a test suite, specify the name of the test suite.
    -startHttpd     Start the http server to view test results
    -w:<directory> | -workDir:<directory>
                    Location for .class files, .jtr files, etc. "./JTwork" is
                    default
    -wsl            (Windows only) Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to
                    run shell tests
    -xml | --xml:verify
                    Create ant/junit xml files into the workDir. Optionally
                    verify if the file is well formed.

Timeout Options
                These options control the behavior when tests run longer than
                their specified timeout value.
    -th:<classname> | -timeoutHandler:<classname>
                    Specifies the class to handle timeouts. The class must
                    extend com.sun.javatest.regtest.TimeoutHandler. E.g.
                    -th:MyHandler
    -thd:<path> | -timeoutHandlerDir:<path>
                    Specifies the pathname of a directory or .jar file in which
                    the timeout handler class is located. The given pathname is
                    simply appended to the CLASSPATH used for the tests, thus
                    care should be taken when naming an timeout handler not to
                    collide with the names of classes internal to the JavaTest
                    harness or the JRE, e.g., put the timeout handler class in
                    its own named package.
    -thtimeout:<#seconds> | -timeoutHandlerTimeout:<#seconds>
                    Specifies execution time limitation for the timeout handler.
                    If the timeout handler does not finish its actions within
                    the specified period of time, it will be interrupted.
                    Non-positive values mean no limitation. The default value is
                    5 minutes (300 seconds).
    -timeout:<number> | -timeoutFactor:<number>
                    A scaling factor to extend the default timeout of all tests.
                    Typically used when running tests on slow systems or systems
                    with slow file systems.
    -tl:<#seconds> | -timelimit:<#seconds>
                    Do not run tests which specify a timeout longer than a given
                    value. The comparison is done against any values specified
                    in the test, before any timeout factor is applied.

Test Selection Options
                These options can be used to refine the set of tests to be
                executed.

    -a | -automatic | -automagic
                    Any test with /manual will not be run
    -bug:<bugid>    Run only those tests which apply to the given bugid.
    -exclude:<file> | -Xexclude:<file>
                    Provide a file specifying tests that should not be run
    -k:<keywordExpr> | -keywords:<keywordExpr>
                    A keyword boolean expression for test selection. The
                    expression can contain keyword names, combined with & (and),
                    | (or), ! (not) and parentheses.
    -m | -manual    Only tests with /manual will be run
    -match:<file>   Provide a file specifying tests that can be run (inverse of
                    -exclude)
    -noshell        Any tests which contain shell actions will not be run
    -shell          Only tests which contain shell actions will be run
    -status:<value>,...
                    Select tests according to their result in an earlier run.
                    The value can be one or more of the following values,
                    separated by commas.
        pass            Tests that passed
        fail            Tests that failed
        notRun          Tests that have not been run
        error           Tests that could not be run because of errors, or tests
                        that were ignored

Test Mode Options
                Each test consists of a series of steps, called actions. The
                jtreg harness provides different modes, which determine the JVM
                to use to execute each action. The default is to run each action
                in a new JVM.

    -avm | -agentvm | -s | -svm | -samevm
                    Execute each action using a pool of reusable JVMs, except
                    when an action specifies otherwise. It provides good
                    performance, and reasonable isolation between actions: if a
                    JVM can be reset to a standard state after it has been used,
                    it will be returned to the pool for reuse; otherwise, it
                    will be discarded and replaced if and when necessary. This
                    mode is generally recommended for all use.
                    The JDK to use can be specified with -testjdk or -jdk,
                    except for @compile actions, which use -compilejdk or -jdk.
                    If values are not provided, the environment variable
                    JAVA_HOME is used.
    -ovm | -othervm
                    Execute every action in a new JVM. This is the default. It
                    provides the maximum isolation between actions, at a
                    significant cost in performance.
                    The JDK to use can be specified with -testjdk or -jdk,
                    except for @compile actions, which use -compilejdk or -jdk.
                    If values are not provided, the environment variable
                    JAVA_HOME is used.

JDK-related Options
                By default, tests will be run using the default JVM in the test
                JDK. You can pass all applicable JVM options via using
                -vmoption; in addition, many common JVM options are also
                supported directly. For full details of any option, consult the
                documentation for that version of the JDK, or try using "java
                -help" or "java -X". If an option is not applicable to a
                particular platform or JDK release, it will be rejected.

    --add-modules <module>(,<module>)*
                    root modules to resolve in addition to the initial module
    -agentlib:<libname><[=<options>]
                    Load native agent library
    -agentpath:<pathname><[=<options>]
                    Load native agent library by full pathname
    -classic | -green | -native | -hotspot | -client | -server | -d32 | -d64
                    VM Options
    -compilejdk:<java.home>
                    Compile all tests using specified JDK. If not specified,
                    tests are compiled with the JDK used to run the tests. See
                    also -jdk. e.g. -jdk:/usr/local/java/jdk1.5/solaris-sparc
    -cpa:<path> | -classpathappend:<path>
                    Append the provided classPath to the CLASSPATH of every
                    test. This is designed to be used primarily for tests which
                    require non-core JDK functionality. For example, to test
                    Swing, which is not part of core JDK1.1, the following
                    addition to the the CLASSPATH would be necessary:
                    -cpa:/usr/local/java/swing-1.0.3/swingall.jar
    -D<name>=<value>
                    Define a system property
    -debug:<option>...
                    Use this to specify VM options to attach a debugger to a VM
                    running a test. It is similar to -vmoptions except that it
                    is not used when starting VMs used to query the properties
                    of that VM. See also -javaoptions and -vmoptions.
    -enableassertions | --enableassertions:* | -ea | --ea:* | -disableassertions
    | --disableassertions:* | -da | --da:*
                    Enable or disable assertions
    -enablesystemassertions | -esa | -disablesystemassertions | -dsa
                    Enable or disable system assertions
    -javaagent:<jarpath><[=<options>]
                    Load Java programming language agent
    -javacoption:<option>
                    Additional compiler option. You can give this option
                    multiple times. Any embedded filenames must be given with
                    absolute paths.
    -javacoptions:<option>...
                    Additional compiler options. You can give this option
                    multiple times, or give many values together, separated by
                    spaces. If you give multiple values, you may need to enclose
                    them in quotes, depending on the shell you use. Any embedded
                    filenames must be given with absolute paths. Warning: do not
                    use this form if any of the options has an argument such as
                    a filename that might contain spaces. In that case, use one
                    or more -javacoption options instead.
    -javaoption:<option>
                    Additional java option for running test classes. You can
                    give this option multiple times. Any embedded filenames must
                    be given with absolute paths. See also -vmoption.
    -javaoptions:<option>...
                    Additional java options for running test classes. You can
                    give this option multiple times, or give many values
                    together, separated by spaces. If you give multiple values,
                    you may need to enclose them in quotes, depending on the
                    shell you use. Any embedded filenames must be given with
                    absolute paths. Warning: do not use this form if any of the
                    options has an argument such as a filename that might
                    contain spaces. In that case, use one or more -javaoption
                    options instead. See also -vmoptions.
    -jdk:<java.home> | -testjdk:<java.home>
                    Run all tests using specified JDK. e.g.
                    -jdk:/usr/local/java/jdk1.5/solaris-sparc
    -jit            Enable the JIT for the tests. The JIT is turned on by
                    default.
    --limit-modules <module>(,<module>)*
                    limit the universe of observable modules
    -nojit          Disable the JIT for the tests.
    --patch-module <module>=<path>
                    Specify classes to override module classes
    -vmoption:<option>
                    Any other VM option. You can give this option multiple
                    times. Any embedded filenames must be given with absolute
                    paths. This option will be used when compiling and running
                    classes. See also -javaoption.
    -vmoptions:<option>...
                    Any other VM options. You can give this option multiple
                    times, or give many values together, separated by spaces. If
                    you give multiple values, you may need to enclose them in
                    quotes, depending on the shell you use. Any embedded
                    filenames must be given with absolute paths. Warning: do not
                    use this form if any of the options has an argument such as
                    a filename that might contain spaces. In that case, use one
                    or more -vmption options instead. This option will be used
                    when compiling and running classes. See also -javaoptions.
    -X*             Non-standard VM Options.
    -Xbootclasspath:<path>
                    Set search path for bootstrap classes and resources
    -Xbootclasspath/a:<path>
                    Append to end of bootstrap class path
    -Xbootclasspath/p:<path>
                    Prepend in front of bootstrap class path
    -Xint* | -Xmixed* | -Xcomp*
                    Non-standard VM Options
    -Xrunjcov*      Options for running jcov
    -XX* | -Xms* | -Xmx*
                    Non-standard VM Options

Tests           Specifying collections of tests.

    at-files        Long lists of options and tests may be encapsulated in
                    "at-files". Place the options and/or tests in a file and
                    specify the name of the file on the command line with @file.
                    Options or tests that include white space should be enclosed
                    within either single or double quote characters. Comments
                    may be included in the file by prefixing them with '#'. To
                    specify an option beginning with '@' on the command line,
                    use "@@" to avoid @file expansion.

    Groups          A test suite may define named groups of tests. To specify
                    the name of a group of tests on the command line, use
                    test-suite-dir:group-name, where test-suite-dir is a path to
                    the root directory of the test suite (i.e the directory
                    containing the TEST.ROOT file), and where group-name is the
                    name of the group of tests defined in the test suite. If
                    test-suite-dir is omitted it defaults to the value of the
                    -dir option, if given, or to the current directory
                    otherwise.
                    (Note: on Windows, to avoid confusion with absolute path
                    names including a drive specifier, the test-suite-dir must
                    not be specified with a relative path consisting of a single
                    letter.)

                    Groups are defined in a test suite using one or more Java
                    properties files. The names of these files must be listed in
                    the "groups" entry in TEST.ROOT. If the filename is enclosed
                    in square brackets, no error message will be given if the
                    file cannot be found. Within the property files, each entry
                    specifies items to be included or excluded from the group.
                    To include a test or directory of tests, simply specify the
                    name of the test or directory. To exclude a test or
                    directory of tests, use '-' followed by the name of the test
                    or directory. To include the contents of another group, use
                    ':' followed by the name of the group. There must be no
                    spaces between the "-" or ":" and the name that follows.
